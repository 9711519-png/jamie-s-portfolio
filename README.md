### Calculator (2025)

This is a modern, dark-themed desktop calculator with a clean interface and rounded white buttons. It includes standard arithmetic operations, advanced functions such as square root, exponentiation (^), pi (π), and rounding (rnd), along with utilities like negative/positive (+/-), delete (del), and clear (C). The large equals button and responsive display make calculations quick and intuitive. Styled like a macOS app, it features familiar window controls and a compact, user-friendly layout—perfect for both basic and advanced math tasks.
